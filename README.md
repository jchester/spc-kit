Very much a work-in-progress, but here's the basic idea: perform statistical process
control calculations _in SQL_. Why?

1. The database is closest to the data and will be the fastest place to manipulate it.
2. SQL is a lingua franca that any language and framework can interoperate with easily.

But by all that's holy take note of the LICENSE, in which I disclaim all warranties.
If you use this for something involving real consequences, that's on you.
